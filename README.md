# truffle-deploy
truffle-deploy is a very bad project that will ideally allow someone to probably migrate contracts and verify them on Etherscan smoothly. 

## Configuration:

* Add a .env file with the Infura API key and wallet mnemonic, as specified below. (NOTE: This is not used yet because of how underdeveloped the project is, so this is really only here for reference)
  * `INFURA_KEY`
  * `MNEMONIC` 

## Future Implementation
* things
